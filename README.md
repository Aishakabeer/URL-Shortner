A URL shortener is an online tool or service that takes a long web address (URL) and converts it into a shorter, more compact version. This shortened URL still directs to the original webpage. 
Here's how URL shorteners work

When you input a long URL into a URL shortener, the service generates a unique, shorter URL that acts as a redirect.
This shortened URL often uses a different, shorter domain name than the original.
When someone clicks on the shortened URL, the URL shortener's server redirects them to the original, longer URL.

Benefits of using URL shorteners

Sharing on platforms with character limits: Shortened URLs are ideal for social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) where character counts are restricted.
Enhanced aesthetics: Long, unwieldy URLs can look messy in print or online. Shortened links improve the visual appeal of your content.
Improved memorability: Shorter links are easier to remember and type manually.
Tracking and analytics: Many URL shorteners offer features to track clicks, geographic location of users, and other data, providing valuable insights into link performance.
Customization and branding: Some services allow you to customize the shortened link with your brand name, creating a more professional and recognizable presence

1. Switching to dark mode:

* To enable or disable the dark theme, locate the "Theme" or "Display Settings" option (often represented by a sun/moon icon or a gear icon) within the settings menu.

* Selecting this option will toggle between the light and dark interfaces. The dark theme provides a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments and a sleek, modern aesthetic. 

2. Copying your shortened URL:

* After shortening your URL, a shortened version will be displayed prominently.

* Next to this shortened URL, you'll find a "Copy" button.

* Clicking this button will automatically copy the shortened URL to your clipboard, allowing you to easily paste it into emails, messages, social media posts, or any other application.
